            "Hey guys! So I have a friend of mine who is working on a charity project. They are trying to make an app that continually updates non-profit volunteer opportunities. It's a bit more complicated than that but that's the super baseline idea of the project. I mean i would love to take it on, however my app-making abilities are trash. It's not a huge time commitment and you'd only have to work on it as an occasional weekend thing. So basically they are trying to take a list of events that are submitted by various charities. If this sounds like something you're interested in, please message Alyssa Ashcraft. Thanks guys!!", 1
